7. DUT set up

   Before starting to perform the tests, the DUT to be tested MUST be
   configured following the instructions provided to the user.
   Specifically, it is expected that all of the supported protocols will
   be configured and enabled during this set up (See Appendix A).  It is
   expected that all of the tests will be run without changing the
   configuration or setup of the DUT in any way other than that required
   to do the specific test.  For example, it is not acceptable to change
   the size of frame handling buffers between tests of frame handling
   rates or to disable all but one transport protocol when testing the
   throughput of that protocol.  It is necessary to modify the
   configuration when starting a test to determine the effect of filters
   on throughput, but the only change MUST be to enable the specific
   filter. The DUT set up SHOULD include the normally recommended
   routing update intervals and keep alive frequency.  The specific
   version of the software and the exact DUT configuration, including
   what functions are disabled, used during the tests MUST be included
   as part of the report of the results.

8. Frame formats

   The formats of the test frames to use for TCP/IP over Ethernet are
   shown in Appendix C: Test Frame Formats.  These exact frame formats
   SHOULD be used in the tests described in this document for this
   protocol/media combination and that these frames will be used as a
   template for testing other protocol/media combinations.  The specific
   formats that are used to define the test frames for a particular test
   series MUST be included in the report of the results.

9. Frame sizes

   All of the described tests SHOULD be performed at a number of frame
   sizes. Specifically, the sizes SHOULD include the maximum and minimum
   legitimate sizes for the protocol under test on the media under test
   and enough sizes in between to be able to get a full characterization
   of the DUT performance.  Except where noted, at least five frame
   sizes SHOULD be tested for each test condition.

   Theoretically the minimum size UDP Echo request frame would consist
   of an IP header (minimum length 20 octets), a UDP header (8 octets)
   and whatever MAC level header is required by the media in use.  The
   theoretical maximum frame size is determined by the size of the
   length field in the IP header.  In almost all cases the actual
   maximum and minimum sizes are determined by the limitations of the
   media.




Bradner & McQuaid            Informational                      [Page 5]

RFC 2544                Benchmarking Methodology              March 1999


   In theory it would be ideal to distribute the frame sizes in a way
   that would evenly distribute the theoretical frame rates.  These
   recommendations incorporate this theory but specify frame sizes which
   are easy to understand and remember.  In addition, many of the same
   frame sizes are specified on each of the media types to allow for
   easy performance comparisons.

   Note: The inclusion of an unrealistically small frame size on some of
   the media types (i.e. with little or no space for data) is to help
   characterize the per-frame processing overhead of the DUT.

9.1 Frame sizes to be used on Ethernet

       64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 1280, 1518

   These sizes include the maximum and minimum frame sizes permitted by
   the Ethernet standard and a selection of sizes between these extremes
   with a finer granularity for the smaller frame sizes and higher frame
   rates.

9.2 Frame sizes to be used on 4Mb and 16Mb token ring

       54, 64, 128, 256, 1024, 1518, 2048, 4472

   The frame size recommendations for token ring assume that there is no
   RIF field in the frames of routed protocols.  A RIF field would be
   present in any direct source route bridge performance test.  The
   minimum size frame for UDP on token ring is 54 octets.  The maximum
   size of 4472 octets is recommended for 16Mb token ring instead of the
   theoretical size of 17.9Kb because of the size limitations imposed by
   many token ring interfaces.  The reminder of the sizes are selected
   to permit direct comparisons with other types of media.  An IP (i.e.
   not UDP) frame may be used in addition if a higher data rate is
   desired, in which case the minimum frame size is 46 octets.

9.3 Frame sizes to be used on FDDI

       54, 64, 128, 256, 1024, 1518, 2048, 4472

   The minimum size frame for UDP on FDDI is 53 octets, the minimum size
   of 54 is recommended to allow direct comparison to token ring
   performance.  The maximum size of 4472 is recommended instead of the
   theoretical maximum size of 4500 octets to permit the same type of
   comparison. An IP (i.e. not UDP) frame may be used in addition if a
   higher data rate is desired, in which case the minimum frame size is
   45 octets.

RFC 2544                Benchmarking Methodology              March 1999


9.4 Frame sizes in the presence of disparate MTUs

   When the interconnect DUT supports connecting links with disparate
   MTUs, the frame sizes for the link with the *larger* MTU SHOULD be
   used, up to the limit of the protocol being tested. If the
   interconnect DUT does not support the fragmenting of frames in the
   presence of MTU mismatch, the forwarding rate for that frame size
   shall be reported as zero.

   For example, the test of IP forwarding with a bridge or router that
   joins FDDI and Ethernet should use the frame sizes of FDDI when going
   from the FDDI to the Ethernet link. If the bridge does not support IP
   fragmentation, the forwarding rate for those frames too large for
   Ethernet should be reported as zero.

10. Verifying received frames

   The test equipment SHOULD discard any frames received during a test
   run that are not actual forwarded test frames.  For example, keep-
   alive and routing update frames SHOULD NOT be included in the count
   of received frames.  In any case, the test equipment SHOULD verify
   the length of the received frames and check that they match the
   expected length.

   Preferably, the test equipment SHOULD include sequence numbers in the
   transmitted frames and check for these numbers on the received
   frames.  If this is done, the reported results SHOULD include in
   addition to the number of frames dropped, the number of frames that
   were received out of order, the number of duplicate frames received
   and the number of gaps in the received frame numbering sequence.
   This functionality is required for some of the described tests.

11. Modifiers

   It might be useful to know the DUT performance under a number of
   conditions; some of these conditions are noted below.  The reported
   results SHOULD include as many of these conditions as the test
   equipment is able to generate.  The suite of tests SHOULD be first
   run without any modifying conditions and then repeated under each of
   the conditions separately.  To preserve the ability to compare the
   results of these tests any frames that are required to generate the
   modifying conditions (management queries for example) will be
   included in the same data stream as the normal test frames in place
   of one of the test frames and not be supplied to the DUT on a
   separate network port.






Bradner & McQuaid            Informational                      [Page 7]

RFC 2544                Benchmarking Methodology              March 1999


11.1 Broadcast frames

   In most router designs special processing is required when frames
   addressed to the hardware broadcast address are received.  In bridges
   (or in bridge mode on routers) these broadcast frames must be flooded
   to a number of ports.  The stream of test frames SHOULD be augmented
   with 1% frames addressed to the hardware broadcast address.  The
   frames sent to the broadcast address should be of a type that the
   router will not need to process.  The aim of this test is to
   determine if there is any effect on the forwarding rate of the other
   data in the stream.  The specific frames that should be used are
   included in the test frame format document. The broadcast frames
   SHOULD be evenly distributed throughout the data stream, for example,
   every 100th frame.

   The same test SHOULD be performed on bridge-like DUTs but in this
   case the broadcast packets will be processed and flooded to all
   outputs.

   It is understood that a level of broadcast frames of 1% is much
   higher than many networks experience but, as in drug toxicity
   evaluations, the higher level is required to be able to gage the
   effect which would otherwise often fall within the normal variability
   of the system performance.  Due to design factors some test equipment
   will not be able to generate a level of alternate frames this low.
   In these cases the percentage SHOULD be as small as the equipment can
   provide and that the actual level be described in the report of the
   test results.

11.2 Management frames

   Most data networks now make use of management protocols such as SNMP.
   In many environments there can be a number of management stations
   sending queries to the same DUT at the same time.

   The stream of test frames SHOULD be augmented with one management
   query as the first frame sent each second during the duration of the
   trial.  The result of the query must fit into one response frame. The
   response frame SHOULD be verified by the test equipment. One example
   of the specific query frame that should be used is shown in Appendix
   C.

11.3 Routing update frames

   The processing of dynamic routing protocol updates could have a
   significant impact on the ability of a router to forward data frames.
   The stream of test frames SHOULD be augmented with one routing update
   frame transmitted as the first frame transmitted during the trial.



Bradner & McQuaid            Informational                      [Page 8]

RFC 2544                Benchmarking Methodology              March 1999


   Routing update frames SHOULD be sent at the rate specified in
   Appendix C for the specific routing protocol being used in the test.
   Two routing update frames are defined in Appendix C for the TCP/IP
   over Ethernet example.  The routing frames are designed to change the
   routing to a number of networks that are not involved in the
   forwarding of the test data.  The first frame sets the routing table
   state to "A", the second one changes the state to "B".  The frames
   MUST be alternated during the trial.

   The test SHOULD verify that the routing update was processed by the
   DUT.

11.4 Filters

   Filters are added to routers and bridges to selectively inhibit the
   forwarding of frames that would normally be forwarded.  This is
   usually done to implement security controls on the data that is
   accepted between one area and another. Different products have
   different capabilities to implement filters.

   The DUT SHOULD be first configured to add one filter condition and
   the tests performed.  This filter SHOULD permit the forwarding of the
   test data stream. In routers this filter SHOULD be of the form:

      forward input_protocol_address to output_protocol_address

   In bridges the filter SHOULD be of the form:

      forward destination_hardware_address

   The DUT SHOULD be then reconfigured to implement a total of 25
   filters.  The first 24 of these filters SHOULD be of the form:

      block input_protocol_address to output_protocol_address

   The 24 input and output protocol addresses SHOULD not be any that are
   represented in the test data stream.  The last filter SHOULD permit
   the forwarding of the test data stream.  By "first" and "last" we
   mean to ensure that in the second case, 25 conditions must be checked
   before the data frames will match the conditions that permit the
   forwarding of the frame. Of course, if the DUT reorders the filters
   or does not use a linear scan of the filter rules the effect of the
   sequence in which the filters are input is properly lost.

   The exact filters configuration command lines used SHOULD be included
   with the report of the results.





Bradner & McQuaid            Informational                      [Page 9]

RFC 2544                Benchmarking Methodology              March 1999


11.4.1 Filter Addresses

   Two sets of filter addresses are required, one for the single filter
   case and one for the 25 filter case.

   The single filter case should permit traffic from IP address
   198.18.1.2 to IP address 198.19.65.2 and deny all other traffic.

   The 25 filter case should follow the following sequence.

         deny aa.ba.1.1 to aa.ba.100.1
         deny aa.ba.2.2 to aa.ba.101.2
         deny aa.ba.3.3 to aa.ba.103.3
           ...
         deny aa.ba.12.12 to aa.ba.112.12
         allow aa.bc.1.2 to aa.bc.65.1
         deny aa.ba.13.13 to aa.ba.113.13
         deny aa.ba.14.14 to aa.ba.114.14
           ...
         deny aa.ba.24.24 to aa.ba.124.24
         deny all else


   All previous filter conditions should be cleared from the router
   before this sequence is entered.  The sequence is selected to test to
   see if the router sorts the filter conditions or accepts them in the
   order that they were entered.  Both of these procedures will result
   in a greater impact on performance than will some form of hash
   coding.

12. Protocol addresses

   It is easier to implement these tests using a single logical stream
   of data, with one source protocol address and one destination
   protocol address, and for some conditions like the filters described
   above, a practical requirement. Networks in the real world are not
   limited to single streams of data. The test suite SHOULD be first run
   with a single protocol (or hardware for bridge tests) source and
   destination address pair.  The tests SHOULD then be repeated with
   using a random destination address.  While testing routers the
   addresses SHOULD be random and uniformly distributed over a range of
   256 networks and random and uniformly distributed over the full MAC
   range for bridges.  The specific address ranges to use for IP are
   shown in Appendix C.







Bradner & McQuaid            Informational                     [Page 10]

RFC 2544                Benchmarking Methodology              March 1999


13. Route Set Up

   It is not reasonable that all of the routing information necessary to
   forward the test stream, especially in the multiple address case,
   will be manually set up.  At the start of each trial a routing update
   MUST be sent to the DUT. This routing update MUST include all of the
   network addresses that will be required for the trial.  All of the
   addresses SHOULD resolve to the same "next-hop". Normally this will
   be the address of the receiving side of the test equipment. This
   routing update will have to be repeated at the interval required by
   the routing protocol being used.  An example of the format and
   repetition interval of the update frames is given in Appendix C.

14. Bidirectional traffic

   Normal network activity is not all in a single direction.  To test
   the bidirectional performance of a DUT, the test series SHOULD be run
   with the same data rate being offered from each direction. The sum of
   the data rates should not exceed the theoretical limit for the media.

15. Single stream path

   The full suite of tests SHOULD be run along with whatever modifier
   conditions that are relevant using a single input and output network
   port on the DUT. If the internal design of the DUT has multiple
   distinct pathways, for example, multiple interface cards each with
   multiple network ports, then all possible types of pathways SHOULD be
   tested separately.

16. Multi-port

   Many current router and bridge products provide many network ports in
   the same module. In performing these tests first half of the ports
   are designated as "input ports" and half are designated as "output
   ports".  These ports SHOULD be evenly distributed across the DUT
   architecture. For example if a DUT has two interface cards each of
   which has four ports, two ports on each interface card are designated
   as input and two are designated as output.  The specified tests are
   run using the same data rate being offered to each of the input
   ports.  The addresses in the input data streams SHOULD be set so that
   a frame will be directed to each of the output ports in sequence so
   that all "output" ports will get an even distribution of packets from
   this input.  The same configuration MAY be used to perform a
   bidirectional multi-stream test.  In this case all of the ports are
   considered both input and output ports and each data stream MUST
   consist of frames addressed to all of the other ports.





Bradner & McQuaid            Informational                     [Page 11]

RFC 2544                Benchmarking Methodology              March 1999


   Consider the following 6 port DUT:

                              --------------
                     ---------| in A  out X|--------
                     ---------| in B  out Y|--------
                     ---------| in C  out Z|--------
                              --------------

   The addressing of the data streams for each of the inputs SHOULD be:

    stream sent to input A:
      packet to out X, packet to out Y, packet to out Z
    stream sent to input B:
      packet to out X, packet to out Y, packet to out Z
    stream sent to input C
      packet to out X, packet to out Y, packet to out Z

   Note that these streams each follow the same sequence so that 3
   packets will arrive at output X at the same time, then 3 packets at
   Y, then 3 packets at Z. This procedure ensures that, as in the real
   world, the DUT will have to deal with multiple packets addressed to
   the same output at the same time.

17. Multiple protocols

   This document does not address the issue of testing the effects of a
   mixed protocol environment other than to suggest that if such tests
   are wanted then frames SHOULD be distributed between all of the test
   protocols.  The distribution MAY approximate the conditions on the
   network in which the DUT would be used.

18. Multiple frame sizes

   This document does not address the issue of testing the effects of a
   mixed frame size environment other than to suggest that if such tests
   are wanted then frames SHOULD be distributed between all of the
   listed sizes for the protocol under test.  The distribution MAY
   approximate the conditions on the network in which the DUT would be
   used. The authors do not have any idea how the results of such a test
   would be interpreted other than to directly compare multiple DUTs in
   some very specific simulated network.

19. Testing performance beyond a single DUT.

   In the performance testing of a single DUT, the paradigm can be
   described as applying some input to a DUT and monitoring the output.
   The results of which can be used to form a basis of characterization
   of that device under those test conditions.



Bradner & McQuaid            Informational                     [Page 12]

RFC 2544                Benchmarking Methodology              March 1999


   This model is useful when the test input and output are homogenous
   (e.g., 64-byte IP, 802.3 frames into the DUT; 64 byte IP, 802.3
   frames out), or the method of test can distinguish between dissimilar
   input/output. (E.g., 1518 byte IP, 802.3 frames in; 576 byte,
   fragmented IP, X.25 frames out.)

   By extending the single DUT test model, reasonable benchmarks
   regarding multiple DUTs or heterogeneous environments may be
   collected. In this extension, the single DUT is replaced by a system
   of interconnected network DUTs. This test methodology would support
   the benchmarking of a variety of device/media/service/protocol
   combinations. For example, a configuration for a LAN-to-WAN-to-LAN
   test might be:

   (1) 802.3-> DUT 1 -> X.25 @ 64kbps -> DUT 2 -> 802.3

   Or a mixed LAN configuration might be:

   (2) 802.3 -> DUT 1 -> FDDI -> DUT 2 -> FDDI -> DUT 3 -> 802.3

   In both examples 1 and 2, end-to-end benchmarks of each system could
   be empirically ascertained. Other behavior may be characterized
   through the use of intermediate devices. In example 2, the
   configuration may be used to give an indication of the FDDI to FDDI
   capability exhibited by DUT 2.

   Because multiple DUTs are treated as a single system, there are
   limitations to this methodology. For instance, this methodology may
   yield an aggregate benchmark for a tested system. That benchmark
   alone, however, may not necessarily reflect asymmetries in behavior
   between the DUTs, latencies introduce by other apparatus (e.g.,
   CSUs/DSUs, switches), etc.

   Further, care must be used when comparing benchmarks of different
   systems by ensuring that the DUTs' features/configuration of the
   tested systems have the appropriate common denominators to allow
   comparison.

20. Maximum frame rate

   The maximum frame rates that should be used when testing LAN
   connections SHOULD be the listed theoretical maximum rate for the
   frame size on the media.








Bradner & McQuaid            Informational                     [Page 13]

RFC 2544                Benchmarking Methodology              March 1999


   The maximum frame rate that should be used when testing WAN
   connections SHOULD be greater than the listed theoretical maximum
   rate for the frame size on that speed connection.  The higher rate
   for WAN tests is to compensate for the fact that some vendors employ
   various forms of header compression.

   A list of maximum frame rates for LAN connections is included in
   Appendix B.

21. Bursty traffic

   It is convenient to measure the DUT performance under steady state
   load but this is an unrealistic way to gauge the functioning of a DUT
   since actual network traffic normally consists of bursts of frames.
   Some of the tests described below SHOULD be performed with both
   steady state traffic and with traffic consisting of repeated bursts
   of frames.  The frames within a burst are transmitted with the
   minimum legitimate inter-frame gap.

   The objective of the test is to determine the minimum interval
   between bursts which the DUT can process with no frame loss. During
   each test the number of frames in each burst is held constant and the
   inter-burst interval varied.  Tests SHOULD be run with burst sizes of
   16, 64, 256 and 1024 frames.

22. Frames per token

   Although it is possible to configure some token ring and FDDI
   interfaces to transmit more than one frame each time that the token
   is received, most of the network devices currently available transmit
   only one frame per token.  These tests SHOULD first be performed
   while transmitting only one frame per token.

   Some current high-performance workstation servers do transmit more
   than one frame per token on FDDI to maximize throughput.  Since this
   may be a common feature in future workstations and servers,
   interconnect devices with FDDI interfaces SHOULD be tested with 1, 4,
   8, and 16 frames per token.  The reported frame rate SHOULD be the
   average rate of frame transmission over the total trial period.
